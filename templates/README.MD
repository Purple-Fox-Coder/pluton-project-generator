# $$PROJECT_NAME$$
----------------------

##### Compilation

A makefile is provided for simplicity, however due to this make and G++ are
required to compile.  Of note the makefile was made on linux, but it should work
on windows.

To compile simply run:  
``make``

Then to run it use:  
``./bin/$$PROJECT_ALIAS$$.exe``
